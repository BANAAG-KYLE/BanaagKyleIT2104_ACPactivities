## 📚 Laboratory Activities Overview

### 🎯 Laboratory Activity 1 – Introduction to Python

**Purpose:**  
To establish a strong foundation in Python programming fundamentals by practicing:
- Input/output operations with multiple data types (integers, strings)
- Proper variable naming conventions and code organization
- Basic string formatting and output presentation
- Working with built-in Python functions like `max()` and `ord()`
- Understanding ASCII values and character comparisons

#### Item 1: Music Catalog Manager 🎵  
**Code Summary:**  
Develops a program that captures and displays musical information through structured user input. The program handles various data types including integers for release years and strings for artistic details, demonstrating fundamental input/output operations.

#### Item 2: Character Value Analyzer 📊  
**Code Summary:**  
Creates a system that evaluates and compares two character inputs using Python's built-in functions. Features optional ASCII value display functionality, showcasing string handling and numerical conversions.

**Instructions for Reviewers:**  
- 🖋️ **Input valid album details**: Ensure that the information entered for the album is accurate and correctly formatted.  
- ✅ **Verify output accuracy**: Confirm that the program displays the entered album details correctly.  
- 🔍 **Test with various inputs**: Try different character inputs, including uppercase, lowercase, and special characters, to observe how the program handles them.

### 🎯 Laboratory Activity 2 – Libraries and Control Flow

**Purpose:**  
To deepen understanding of Python's control structures and algorithm implementation through:
- Implementation of number palindrome checking algorithms
- Application of conditional statements (discount calculations)
- Handling decimal precision in calculations
- Creating user-friendly input/output interfaces
- Implementing program flow control with retry options

#### Item 1: Numeric Palindrome Detector 🔄  
**Code Summary:**  
Implements an algorithm to identify palindromic numbers through digit manipulation and comparison. The program processes integer inputs and determines if they read the same forwards and backwards.

#### Item 2: Dynamic Discount Calculator 💰  
**Code Summary:**  
Develops a sophisticated pricing system that calculates purchase discounts based on total amount. Features percentage-based calculations, decimal formatting, and an interactive retry mechanism for multiple calculations.

**Instructions for Reviewers:**  
- 🖋️ **Enter valid numerical values**: Provide appropriate numbers when prompted to ensure accurate calculations.  
- ✅ **Check discount calculations**: Verify that the discount applied matches the specified criteria based on the input amount.  
- 🔍 **Test limit conditions**: Validate the program using values at the discount boundaries to ensure accurate processing.

### 🎯 Laboratory Activity 3 – Dictionaries and Lists

**Purpose:**  
To master Python's data structures and algorithmic problem-solving by:
- Working with dictionaries to map Roman numerals to integer values
- Implementing conversion algorithms (Roman to Integer)
- Handling string processing and validation
- Understanding and implementing mathematical concepts (perfect numbers)
- Processing numerical sequences and divisibility rules

#### Item 1: Roman Numeral Converter 🔢  
**Code Summary:**  
Creates a system for converting Roman numerals to integers using dictionary mapping and string processing. Handles both standard and subtractive notation while maintaining proper validation rules.

#### Item 2: Perfect Number Validator ✨  
**Code Summary:**  
Implements an algorithm to identify perfect numbers through divisor calculation and summation. The program analyzes numerical properties and determines if a number's proper divisors sum equals the original number.

**Instructions for Reviewers:**  
- 🖋️ **Input valid Roman numerals**: Ensure that the Roman numerals entered are correctly formatted and valid.  
- ✅ **Confirm integer conversion accuracy**: Check that the program accurately converts Roman numerals to their integer equivalents.  
- 🔍 **Test edge cases**: Enter both simple and complex Roman numerals to evaluate the program's reliability.

### 🎯 Laboratory Activity 4 – Python OOP and Exception Handling

**Purpose:**  
To apply advanced Python programming concepts through:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation with the Capybara class
- Proper class structure with constructors and properties
- Type hinting and parameter validation
- Exception handling with arrays and user inputs
- Working with floating-point precision
- Implementing error messages and input validation
- Creating organized code structures with multiple files

#### Item 1: Capybara Class Implementation 🦫  
**Code Summary:**  
Develops an object-oriented structure representing capybaras and their characteristics. Features proper class construction, attribute management, and type validation while demonstrating OOP principles.

#### Item 2: Array Exception Manager ⚠️  
**Code Summary:**  
Creates a system for handling array operations with comprehensive exception handling. Implements size-based array creation, element access validation, and formatted decimal output with proper error messaging.

**Instructions for Reviewers:**  
- 🖋️ **Create instances of the Capybara class**: Test the class by creating multiple instances with different attributes.  
- ✅ **Verify method functionality**: Ensure that all methods within the `Capybara` class perform as expected.  
- 🔍 **Test exception handling**: Intentionally cause errors (e.g., file not found) to observe how the program manages exceptions.
